# ApartmentManagementSystem
This project was created during my 5th semester with my team members where we used HTML,CSS,Javascript as the frontend.
We used PHP as the backend language and MySQL as database storage.
the website was a static one which had important pages like:
1. login page
2. Signup page
3. Home page
4. Complain page
5. Services page
6. Contact us page
7. Gate update page
8. Myunit page
9. Complain Status page
10. Discover page
In this repositary there would be all the files and images which were during website development.
